                        <h2>Hard-Core Handling, Soft Brake Pedal</h2>
                        <p>The Evo's many adaptive systems all run though the new Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo
                            Integrata, or
                            LDVI if you can't fake the Italian. LDVI combines the old car's individual processors for
                            the
                            all-wheel-drive system, the adaptive dampers, and the stability control into a single
                            computer
                            that also manages the rear-wheel steering and Lambo's first use of brake-based torque
                            vectoring.
                            While the outgoing Huracán took its orders from a set of reactive algorithms, this new
                            system
                            uses feed-forward logic to predict the driver's intentions and sharpen or soften the car's
                            responses accordingly. Lamborghini tells us that LDVI makes adjustments 50 times per second,
                            juggling an unfathomable number of data channels. The computer considers 240 inputs
                            including
                            pitch, roll, yaw, acceleration in every direction, wheel positions, steering angle, the
                            driver's
                            social-media following, and how long ago the passenger last ate. Okay, we made up those last
                            two, but there's got to be some fat in there, considering the computer spits out an
                            incomprehensible 340 outputs. Even with all those variables in play, we found one consistent
                            result: Driven fast, the Huracán Evo will always feed the driver's ego.

                        <p>The standard carbon-ceramic brake rotors struggle to keep up when the Evo's estimated 3500
                            pounds are hustled. Setting the pace for our lead-follow laps, Lamborghini's professional
                            drivers frequently lifted on the Formula 1 circuit's long straights and moved to the left
                            pedal well before they reached the braking markers placed at the track's edge just for our
                            drive. And even that wasn't enough to prevent the pedal from going soft during sessions that
                            were limited to just three laps. In fairness, we were not the first or the last drivers to
                            take the cars on track. The Evos on hand could have been abused to the point that the
                            braking performance was compromised. Fresh fluid, pads, and tires could fix this, so we will
                            wait for a proper C/D test before we pass judgment on the Evo's brakes.</p>

                        <h2>A 10-Cylinder, 631-HP Seismic Event</h2>
                        <p>The Evo's 631-hp V-10 is lifted directly from the Huracán Performante with only slight
                            software
                            and exhaust changes. As in the Performante, every trip to the 8500-rpm redline packs a
                            forceful
                            indictment of its turbocharged rivals. Running almost in step with the Performante, the Evo
                            should notch 60 mph in 2.4 seconds and close the quarter-mile in less than 10.5 seconds.

                            us again why our exotics need forced induction?</p>
