            <h1>The 2020 Lamborghini Huracán Evo Is a Better V-10 Supercar</h1>
            <h2>Lamborghini's mid-cycle refresh helps the Huracán accelerate and turn, but the brakes might need
                work.</h2>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="centerevo"><img src="Image/e1.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <div class="mt">
        <p>The drawn-out life cycles of big-buck, low-volume vehicles mean that supercars face the same kind of mid-life
            crises that are typically ascribed to their owners. That's why we're now flooded with unending variations of
            mid-engined exotics. There are convertibles, performance specials, and even mid-cycle facelifts—just like
            your Hyundai Sonata! Arriving five years into the model's production lifetime, <a> 2020 Lamborghini Huracán
                Evo</a> is just that, a freshening of Lamborghini's starter supercar. The Evo adds rear-wheel steering
            and a
            29-hp injection to the Huracán's 5.2-liter V-10, raising output to 631 horsepower. Magnetorheological
            dampers and variable-ratio steering—optional on the outgoing Huracán—are standard on the Evo, and the old
            Audi-based infotainment system is replaced with an all-new Lamborghini-exclusive unit.</p>
        <p>The Evo builds on Lamborghini's newfound knack for weight-be-damned performance.<a> The 2012 Aventador
                LP700-4</a>
            marked the transformation of Lambo's iconic wedges from creatine-huffing four-wheeled pinups to
            creatine-huffing athletes. Following in 2014, the Huracán demonstrated that Lambo's rejuvenated interest in
            vehicle dynamics wasn't a fluke. As evidence of its shifting priorities, Lamborghini even claimed the
            production-car lap record around the Nürburgring Nordschleife, twice—first with<a> the Huracán
                Performante</a> and
            later with <a>the Aventador SVJ</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="centerevo"><img src="/Image/e0.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <div class="mt">
        <p>Starting at about $268,000, the Evo is less of a specialist than those track heroes. It's intended to be a
            daily driver for the South Beach set rather than a weekend lap dog. Nevertheless, Lamborghini confined our
            first drive to breakneck tours around the 15 turns of the 3.5-mile Bahrain Formula 1 circuit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="centerevo"><img src="/Image/e2.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <h2 class="h2left">Hard-Core Handling, Soft Brake Pedal
    </h2>
    <div class="mt">
        <p>The Evo's many adaptive systems all run though the new Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata, or LDVI if you
            can't fake the Italian. LDVI combines the old car's individual processors for the all-wheel-drive system,
            the adaptive dampers, and the stability control into a single computer that also manages the rear-wheel
            steering and Lambo's first use of brake-based torque vectoring. While the outgoing Huracán took its orders
            from a set of reactive algorithms, this new system uses feed-forward logic to predict the driver's
            intentions and sharpen or soften the car's responses accordingly. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="centerevo"><img src="Image/e-1.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <div class="mt">
        <p>In Sport mode, the Evo playfully teases past the limits of the optional Pirelli P Zero Corsa PZC4 tires
            (regular P Zeros are standard). By imperceptibly squeezing individual brake rotors, the torque-vectoring
            program encourages the driver to corner with the tail out. The Evo's Corsa mode plays it straighter,
            stopping short of provoking slides but still divvying torque and pulsing brakes to hold a neutral attitude
            in bends, largely indifferent to the nuances of your corner-entry strategy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="centerevo"><img src="Image/e3.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <div class="mt">
        <p>The Evo still doesn't have the front-end bite of a Porsche 911 GT car, nor does it feel as intense as the
            double-edged sword that is <a>the McLaren 720S</a>. Compared to that Brit, which will burn an inattentive or
            sloppy
            driver, this Italian feels less emotional, less challenging, less attuned to the driver's intentions.
            Instead, the Lambo is stable, planted, and forgiving. It barely wags its tiny ducktail spoiler when you
            combine a lateral load with threshold braking or a redline upshift.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="centerevo"><img src="Image/e4.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <h2 class="h2left">A 10-Cylinder, 631-HP Seismic Event</h2>
    <div class="mt">
        <p>The Evo's 631-hp V-10 is lifted directly from the Huracán Performante with only slight software and exhaust
            changes. As in the Performante, every trip to the 8500-rpm redline packs a forceful indictment of its
            turbocharged rivals. Running almost in step with the Performante, the Evo should notch 60 mph in 2.4 seconds
            and close the quarter-mile in less than 10.5 seconds. Remind us again why our exotics need forced induction?
        </p>
        <p>

            In the campaign to save the endangered naturally aspirated species, the Huracán Evo needs help the same way
            the giant panda does. No one should waste time presenting a rational case for free-breathing engines. It's a
            purely emotional argument. You don't even need to be inside the car to understand. Just being in its
            presence draws out deep reverence and a shot of adrenaline. An Evo passing at full wail is a seismic event,
            exciting a buzz in the concrete that you feel in the soles of your shoes. The exhaust tips have been moved
            higher to accommodate a larger diffuser, and they are now at the perfect height so that anyone who can keep
            up can see the cherry-red glow of 10-cylinder fury through the outlets.</p>

    <h2 class="h2left">Touchy-Feely Stuff
    </h2>
    <div class="mt">
        <p>It's one of life's great ironies that the price of a car and the quality of its infotainment system are
            typically inversely related. Lamborghini is making strides to address that with the Evo's new vertically
            oriented 8.4-inch touchscreen in the center console. It replaces the outgoing Huracán's poorly integrated
            Audi MMI system, which displayed a sort of rectangular picture-in-picture of Audi's MMI system inside a
            banana-shaped digital instrument cluster.</p>
