            <p><strong>A</strong> supercar should always mean blistering acceleration, extreme G forces, a bit of
                discomfort, and,
                perhaps, a relentless admiration and/or deep loathing from the general population. But from behind
                the wheel of a Lamborghini, these things are all amplified by a factor of 20.</p>
            <p>What I discovered after spending an entire weekend alongside Lambo’s latest open-top super bull, the
                Huracan Evo, wasn’t how blindingly quick, stunningly loud or impeccably precise it is. Or even how
                it masters the art of inflating its driver’s ego. The Evo's best trick is actually how quickly it
                gathers people’s attention.</p>

        <h2 class="h2left">What’s An Evo?</h2>
        <div class="maintext">
            <p>While the Evo name may remind you of a certain Mitsubishi that once tore up rally stages, it’s
                actually how Lamborghini wants everyone to call the Huracan now. Since the 2020 model year, all
                Huracans (Huaracanes?) are Evos, which precisely means that: a careful evolution of an already
                emotional supercar, or if you prefer, the first real refresh for Lambo’s baby supercar.</p>
            <p>I say emotional, because the Huracan’s original mission, or any Lamborghini for that matter, was
                never about top speeds or record-setting lap times. The company's ethos instead focuses on drama,
                striking looks and a colorful soundtrack meant to stir your soul nd live in your memories forever.

                But then, one morning, Lamborghini woke up and decided it wanted to take on rivals Ferrari and
                McLaren in the numbers war. Just like that, in a “screw this” moment, Sant’Agata downright smashed
                the Nürburgring lap record for a production car with the Huracan Performante, a more focused version
                of the Huracan at the time. The Performante set a time of 6 minutes, 52 seconds, no less, putting
                Lamborghini back in the spotlight as a brand that could back up the inevitable stares on Ocean Drive
                with real performance.</p>
            <p>The Evo effectively carries over this newfound vigor by utilizing the Performante’s engine as
                standard equipment; in this case, a performance-tuned 5.2-liter V10 (then again, is there such a
                thing as a non-performance tuned Lamborghini engine?), that cranks things up from an already
                excessive 602 horsepower to a downright gut-wrenching 631. Torque was also slightly bumped from 413
                to 443 lb-ft.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hurabox">
            <img src="/Image/f8.jpg" alt="">

        </div>
        <div class="maintext">
            <p>The Evo makeover opens up the Huracán’s face courtesy of a new bumper with integrated splitter and
                enlarged air intakes. Lamborghini says those intakes actually improve aerodynamic performance. The
                car’s rear fascia also gets the Performante treatment with high-mounted sports exhausts, an
                integrated spoiler, and a rear diffusor that also increases downforce. New wheel designs help the
                Evo stand out as a meaner, fresher Huracan.</p>
            <p>Inside, not much changes except for a slight reshuffling of available color and fabric combinations,
                as well as updated digital displays. I’m a personal fan of the Forged Composite surfaces, a kind of
                superhero carbon fiber texture only Lamborghini could have conceptualized. It looks like marble, and
                gives the car a uniquely expensive look and feel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="centerHURA">
            <img src="/Image/f12.jpg" alt="">
            <img src="/Image/f13.jpg" alt=""></div>
    </div>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>The most substantial cabin update though is Lamborghini’s all-new in-house infotainment system, which
            ditches the old Audi-sourced MMI-styled interface for a much cleaner touch-screen unit. The system comes
            with an 8.4-inch screen and Android Auto/Apple CarPlay compatibility.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2left">Let’s Geek Out A Bit</h2>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>I promised myself I wouldn’t flood my readers with endless bits of technical information, as I figured a
            Google search or two can take care of that for you. But I do feel the need to waste a bit of internet
            ink telling you about the car’s charismatically named Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata (LDVI)
            supercomputer.</p>
        <p>Lambo’s quite proud of this gizmo, and with reason, as it funnels all sorts of data to a central
            processor to optimize the car’s performance for any situation. The car basically analyzes your habits
            and their environments and then sets itself up accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="centerHURA"><img src="/Image/f14.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>For instance, it can adjust rear-wheel steering (yes this Lambo has a rear-wheel steering system like an
            old Honda Prelude) so it can better work alongside the brake-based torque vectoring system, and adaptive
            dampers for improved nimbleness. The car basically anticipates what’s coming next.</p>
        <p>Even more remarkable is how it memorizes your favorite drive modes, like whether you prefer driving it in
            manual or automatic mode. The Evo even scans how your feet operate its pedals so it can better react to
            your future inputs.</p>
      
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2left">The Supercar Face</h2>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>I didn’t feel exactly fit for this Lambo Spyder. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll take open-top motoring during
            the summer months any day, and the absence of a roof considerably improves the Huracan’s headroom, or
            lack thereof. Makes the fantastic engine sound louder too.</p>
        <p>My issue with the no-roof situation is that everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, stares at you, to the point
            where the experience becomes somewhat embarrassing. My girlfriend absolutely hated this car for that
            precise reason—“Can you drop me off a little further, I don’t want everyone to see me climbing out of
            this thing”—she’d tell me as we’d run a few errands.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hurabox">
        <img src="/Image/f15.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="/Image/f16.jpg" alt="">

        <img src="/Image/f18.jpg" alt="" class="bighura">
    </div>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>People’s reactions to this thing are downright fascinating, and at times a little worrying. Mind you, the
            current pandemic context certainly doesn’t help. In a world where people are struggling financially and,
            well, dying, seeing a douchebag pass by them in a nearly half-million-dollar sports car surely garners
            reactions. It felt very strange to be in this thing right now, even if I didn't actually own it.</p>
        <p>At least, people are generally happy when they spot a Lamborghini. Smiles are targeted right at you, from
            both men and women. Automotive enthusiasts are quick to send you the usual positive nod or thumbs up
            movement. Children go downright berserk, while teenagers peep at you through the lenses of their
            Instagram stories.</p>

    <div class="maintext">
        <p>“How much?" was the question I got the most, to which the words<a> “more than you can afford, pal”</a>
            would
            spin around tirelessly in my mind.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2left">The Drive</h2>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>This eventually had me wanting to leave the city. So I did exactly that. After garnering more attention
            than a Hollywood star and destroying my back on Montreal’s god-awful streets, I hit the road into the
            countryside in an attempt to explore what this rocketship was capable of.</p>
        <p>That said, I will say that the Evo's adaptive suspension is rather superb when set to Strada mode, the
            car’s most toned-down setting. Cracks in the pavement, bumps, and uneven roads don’t mess up your spine
            that much, which is great. There’s actual compliance in the way the Evo takes on a hole in the road.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="centerHURA"><img src="/Image/f20.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>Also, I found myself extremely thankful for nose-lift technology, as raising the front suspension is a
            much simpler affair here than it is in a McLaren. The only thing the Huracan asks of you is to pull on a
            toggle switch, versus McLaren’s confusing cruise control-like stalk. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the Evo's daily driveability kind of falls apart when attempting to find a comfortable
            seating position. Perhaps if I was a tiny Lamborghini test driver like<a> Valentino Balboni</a>, I’d fit
            comfortably in the Huracan’s seats, but as a six-foot-tall, 230-pound poutine-loving Canadian, the car’s
            snug cockpit meant my enormous balding head was sticking out from over the windshield and my knees were
            kissing the steering column.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="hurabox">
        <img src="/Image/f21.jpg" alt="">

        <img src="/Image/f24.jpg" alt="" class="bighura">
    </div>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>Somehow though, all of that quickly dissolves as you set the Huracan Evo to Sport mode, allowing the car
            to rapidly firm up its dampers and open up some exhaust valves to let the ten-cylinder sing. Plus,
            Lamborghini engineers made sure to program a sharp throttle blip when Sport mode is engaged, so the cars
            behind you know shit’s about to get real.</p>
        <p>Sport mode is where the sweet spot is, or what my Lamborghini rep likes to call the “fun mode." In Sport,
            the exhaust note is considerably louder. Crackles and pops are prominently more apparent during
            downshifts. The car is stiffer overall, but things remain somewhat compliant. The car’s traction control
            system provides the right safety net to explore the car’s potential, but still keeps things in check if
            you dare flirt with its rambunctious character.</p>
        <p>Lamborghini says Sport mode was designed to be playful and let the rear end kick out more. Since I didn’t
            drive the car on a track, it was impossible for me to test those drifting claims.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="centerHURA"><img src="/Image/f25.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>Hit the throttle, and Lambo’s open-air tub jolts forward in the same kind of dramatic velocity as a speed
            bike. The engine shrieks its way to redline in a violent concerto of high-pitched decibels. Revs climb
            so fast you barely have time to realize you’re bouncing off the rev limiter.</p>
        <p><em>Time to shift. Click. Go.</em> I was back on the throttle. Everything was now a large blur, the
            wailing
            10-cylinder had my ears ringing, and whatever hair I had left was now a hairy patch on the pavement
            behind me. All hairs on my body were up, my pupils were dilated, and my palms were firmly clenched
            around the Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel. It's like<a> that famous scene</a> in<em> 2001: A Space
                Odyssey,</em>
            except all of the time.</p>]

        <p>Perhaps where the Evo impressed me the most wasn’t how fast it covered ground, but rather how it
            delivered that speed. In the Huracan Evo Spyder, performance is a wind-filled opera-like theatre act
            where your sensory receptors get cranked up to eleven. Suddenly, my face, the one everyone could see,
            had transformed into 5-year-old me on the Christmas morning I got my first Nintendo.</p>
        <p>But while its stinking performance, outrageous character and ego-inflating abilities got me more excited
            than a fat kid facing a birthday cake, what I actually admired the most about this Italian masterpiece
            was how much happiness it brought to people’s lives while I had it.</p>
