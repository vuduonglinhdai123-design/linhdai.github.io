                <p>► Stunningly good looks with extreme performance</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Well, not<em> new per se</em>, but lightly facelifted in 2017 to incorporate parts that aim to
                    improve the
                    Av’s
                    major failing: it was a bit of a brute to drive. However, there’s a delicate balance to be struck
                    here,
                    because we wouldn’t want to see what could be perceived as ‘character’ being replaced by a more
                    anodyne
                    nature. A world without wide, unruly, visibility-bereft V12 Lamborhginis would undoubtedly be a step
                    backwards for mankind akin to canning Concorde.</p>

            <h2 class="lefth2">Rear-wheel steering for 2018 Lamborghini Aventador S</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>The addition of rear-wheel steering is the major change. Counter-rotating rears tighten the turning
                    circle at low speed, while driven quicker you find all four wheels turn in the same direction, which
                    effectively lengthens the wheelbase to improve stability. This isn’t new tech, but it is effective
                    in lending the Aventador S an approachability that was hitherto absent.</p>
                <p>Its rear magnetic dampers have been retuned too, and the all-wheel drive system is more rear-biased
                    to improve driver engagement. It’s a far wieldier thing with these tweaks; less prone to diving
                    nose-first into bends and still compliant in all modes, despite 20% stiffer springs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="leftpic"><img src="Image/AR11.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <h2 class="lefth2">Preparing for lift-off</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>We found the smoothest way to drive the S was to lift off the throttle just before each gear change –
                    as you’d expect given this is in effect a manual gearbox. It’s best controlled using the
                    column-mounted paddles, too, rather than leaving the car to decide when to change for itself. The
                    shifts are so ponderous that you’re better off being master of your own automotive destiny.</p>

            <h2 class="lefth2">Lambo piles on the Ego
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>You’ve got the same suite of drive modes as before, but there’s now an Ego setting (translated to
                    English: ego) that allows the driver to pick their own configuration for the drivetrain, steering
                    and suspension.</p>

            <h2 class="lefth2">The less than good…
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>There are a couple of issues, though. First and foremost is the roof, which comprises two panels that
                    need manual removal. They’re designed to be stored in the front luggage compartment, but you won’t
                    get anything else in there at the same time. Best simply leave the 6kg carbonfibre panels in the
                    garage and pray for no rain – or simply keep the car at your summer house in a hot climate. Problem
                    solved.</p>
             
            </div>
            <h2 class="lefth2">Verdict
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>The changes to the Aventador in its maturation to S specification don’t rewrite the rulebook, but do
                    a great job of making a wild child just that little bit easier to live with.</p>
                <p>It’s still uncompromisingly exciting, and for that Lamborghini simply must be applauded. </p>
